Hey 👋🏻,

I have worked as a Steel Making Plant Electrical Engineer for about 4 years but this has made me realize what my passion is as soon as I started coding with python programming language. Not only could I see my future in it, but also my next best decision when it came to a lucrative career that I can rely on. As a matter of fact, Linux and Network Engineering came to play since Python was not my only go-to. I also spent countless hours on courses that made me an engineer when it came to networking and security. CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) and SSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) showed me a glimpse of security and how vitally significant it is to work in the filed if Information Technology.

My Compliments to myself were not giving up in addition to enhancing my repertoire in order to make sure that I can be the best version of myself. Python, Django, DRF (Django Rest Framework), Web Design, Linux Engineering and Security as well as Docker are my current specialties. I cannot be more thrilled to see myself standing in a great position, a person who paved the way for himself through only a programming language and non-stop and ongoing progress.

I love applying implementing and designing Database Systems as well as managing back-end applications processes such as manipulating financial transactions as well as financial wallets in startups applications. These came from working as an engineer in a startup called "Cashcool", a startup about creating electronic wallets with the advantage of electronic shopping, online menus, and wallet charging for employees' wallet in order to go shopping online as well as via QRF code.

This was not the end of my journey since I was infatuated with data science through my passion for more knowledge. More and more topics were mentioned and I could see myself without a clue whenever I saw my friends talking about Artificial Intelligence. I started learning Data Science in my free time and the outcome was outstanding; Implementation of classification algorithms such as Decision Tree and Random Forest, kNN, Linear and Non-Linear Regression techniques as well as Clustering Methods such as K-means and Hierarchical algorithms such as single/complete/average linkage on various datasets.

My hobbies are sports, reading, walking and working out, swimming and instrumental and concentration music.
